Welcome to the Maternal Health Screening System

This guide will help you effectively use the offline-first maternal health screening and counseling system designed for serving underserved pregnant women in BPL households.

Key Objectives:
- Deliver risk screening and counseling to underserved communities
- Provide culturally sensitive health education
- Identify high-risk cases for immediate referral
- Maintain accurate health records for government integration

System Capabilities:
- Offline-First: Works without internet connectivity
- AI-Powered: On-device risk assessment and recommendations
- Cultural Sensitivity: Appropriate content for local communities

Maternal Health Screening Process

Pre-Delivery Screening Workflow

1. Initial Assessment
- Verify patient identity and basic information
- Confirm pregnancy status and gestational age
- Review previous pregnancy history if applicable

2. Health Data Collection
- Vital Signs: blood pressure, weight, temperature
- Medical History: previous conditions, family history
- Current Symptoms: any concerning symptoms or complaints
- Social Factors: living conditions, support system

3. Risk Factor Identification
The system will automatically flag:
- High blood pressure (greater than 140/90)
- Extreme maternal age (less than 18 or greater than 35)
- Previous pregnancy complications
- Multiple pregnancies
- Nutritional deficiencies

4. Immediate Actions
- Review AI-generated risk assessment
- Provide appropriate counseling based on risk level
- Schedule follow-up appointments
- Initiate referrals for high-risk cases

Post-Delivery Screening

1. Recovery Assessment
- Physical recovery progress
- Breastfeeding status and challenges
- Mental health screening
- Family planning counseling

2. Newborn Health Check
- Basic newborn assessment
- Vaccination schedule review
- Growth monitoring setup
